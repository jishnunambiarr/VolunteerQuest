VolunteerQuest - Gamifying Intergenerational Bonds

Overview:
VolunteerQuest is a mobile app that aims to reduce loneliness among young adults in Munich by gamifying the process of connecting them with older people. The app provides a fun, rewarding experience for both age groups to form meaningful connections and relationships through various volunteering activities.
Two birds with one stone!

Loneliness is a growing issue, especially among the younger population in urban areas like Munich. Older adults also often lack regular social interaction and a sense of community, which can have negative impacts on their mental and physical well-being. VolunteerQuest bridges this gap by creating a platform that incentivizes younger volunteers to regularly spend time with and assist older adults through various volunteering tasks. The gamification elements help foster a sense of engagement and enjoyment for both age groups, leading to the formation of meaningful intergenerational connections.
